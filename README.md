This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router v6 where routes intermittently fail to render correctly.  The issue manifests as blank screens or unexpected component rendering, despite seemingly correct path configurations.  The problem's inconsistency makes debugging challenging.  The solution provided addresses this by implementing a more robust routing strategy that handles potential edge cases and ensures consistent route matching.
